        <p>Ageratum (/əˈdʒɛrətəm/),[2] (whiteweed in the USA), is
            a genus of 40[3] to 60 tropical and warm temperate flow-
            ering annuals and perennials from the family Asteraceae,
            tribe Eupatorieae. Most species are native to Central
            America and Mexico but four are native to the United
            States.[3]</p>

        <p>They form tussocks or small hills. They grow to a height
            of 30 in. The opposite leaves are cordate or oval, hairy or
            tomentose. The margins are slightly toothed or serrate.
            The leaves form compact clusters.</p>
            
        <p>The fluffy flowers are lavender-blue, pink, lilac, or white;
            and spread in small compound umbels. They give small,
            dry fruits.</p>
