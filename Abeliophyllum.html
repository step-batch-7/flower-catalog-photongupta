        <p>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean
            Abelialeaf) is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in
            the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species,
            Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai, endemic to Korea,
            where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only
            seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having
            white, not yellow, flowers.</p>

        <p>It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1–2 m tall. The leaves
           are opposite, simple, 6–10 cm long and 3-4.5 cm wide,
           pubescent both above and below. The flowers are pro-
           duced in early spring before the new leaves appear; they
           are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed
           corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2–3 cm di-
           ameter.</p>
            
        <p> It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North
           America.</p>
